## 🛠️ Overview
With the **Extracting User Journey Data Case Study**, I queried data to bring insights to the following questions:
1. Consider all users that purchased a subscription plan for the first time between January 1 and March 31, 2023 (inclusive).
2. Consider all their page interactions before their purchase date.
3. Remove test users (ones that paid 0 dollars).
4. Create aliases (nicknames) for the URLs.
5. Combine all the pages of each session into a single user journey string.
6. Export all this data as a CSV with the user_id, session_id, subscription_type, and user journey
